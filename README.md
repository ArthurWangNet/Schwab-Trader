Charles Schwab acquired TD Ameritrade some time ago, resulting in the deprecation of the TD API. The new Schwab API will be the future standard. This project aims to update and replace the original TD API, focusing on fetching, cleaning, and storing daily market data, and potentially utilizing additional capabilities of the new API.

To use this project, you must be a real Schwab customer with a trading account, as the Developer API alone wonâ€™t provide data access.
